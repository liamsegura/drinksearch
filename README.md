## Description
Drinksearch is a user-friendly bar app that allows customers to scan barcodes and access a virtual drinks menu. With an iOS-inspired design, it provides information on up to 100 drinks, including ingredients and instructions.

## Functionality
- Customers can scan a barcode to access the app.
- Users can choose from a virtual drinks menu consisting of up to 100 drinks.
- The app provides information about the ingredients used in each drink.
- Users can also view the instructions on how to make each drink.

## Design
- The app features an iOS-inspired design.
- The design incorporates a glass-like element above a blurred background, resembling the iOS Notification Center.
- The app is fully responsive and was designed using Figma.

## Objective
- The objective of this project was to utilize an extensive database of drink information.
- An API was used to fetch the data and append specific information to the DOM.
- The goal was to create a simple and user-friendly web app.
- The entire app was developed on a single HTML file with a minimal UI.

## Technologies Used
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for coding the project.
- No frameworks or libraries were used.

## Project Overview
- The project started with a predefined design concept, and the implementation of functionality followed.
- The navigation bar includes multiple search options, such as a dynamic search bar, A-Z search, spirit-based search, and a random drink selection.
- Upon obtaining a search value, the app dynamically appends a list of informational cards to the DOM using JavaScript and HTML templates.
- CSS z-index property was extensively used to display the newly created cards above the hero section.
- A modal was implemented to provide additional information when a user clicks on a card.

## Issues Faced
- Some issues were encountered with the API integration.
- To access drink information, a search was needed using a specific ID as a parameter.
- CSS-related challenges included managing overlapping elements and ensuring proper floating behavior.
- JavaScript was utilized to handle closing the mobile soft keyboard on scroll and to set a timeout for the dynamic search functionality.
