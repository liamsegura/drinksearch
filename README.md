Objective

–The objective of this project was to utilize an extensive database of drink information.<br>–An API was used to fetch the data and append specific information to the DOM.<br>–The goal was to create a simple and user-friendly web app.<br>–The entire app was developed on a single HTML file with a minimal UI.
